=== Dynamic Memory Cheating ===

Cheating dynamic memory always requires a preloader which loads a memory
hacking library into the game process. The ugtrain uses "ugpreload" and
"libmemhack" for that. The library gets the unique code addresses of unique
"malloc" calls and their reverse stack offsets as a config through a FIFO.
In return it tells the user of how many memory objects per memory class it can
keep track of. This is important for the freeing of the objects. If ugtrain
wouldn't be informed about the freeing, then this can cause major game
stability issues. Value locations are used as offsets within the objects. They
become only active if at least one object has been allocated. The lib sends
the code and the memory address through a second FIFO to ugtrain. We can use
a special check if the allocated object belongs to us or otherwise an opponent.
If it fails, it removes the object from the active ugtrain in-memory config.
The rest works the same way as with static memory.

The CLI option '-P' is recommended for this. With that libmemhack is preloaded
and the game is started automatically. The advantage is that root permissions
aren't required.

Required config options: "dynmemstart", "dynmemend"
Related config options: "checko"
FIFOs: /tmp/memhack_in, /tmp/memhack_out


=== Dynamic Memory Discovery ===

For discovery another library is required ("libmemdisc"). This one takes a
stage number and the stage parameters as config and is preloaded with ugpreload
as well.

Discovery is done in the following stages:

1. Find the malloc size           (all mallocs and frees are recorded)
2. Verify the malloc size         (frees are ignored)
3. Find the code address
4. Find the reverse stack offset

The ugtrain option '-D' helps with that. It assumes '-P' and libmemdisc. All
we need are the following stage parameters for the '-D' option:

1. "StageNr[;HeapStartOffs;HeapEndOffs]"
2. "StageNr[;HeapStartOffs;HeapEndOffs;MemSize]"
3. "StageNr;HeapStartOffs;HeapEndOffs;MemSize[;CodeStart;CodeEnd]"
4. "StageNr;HeapStartOffs;HeapEndOffs;MemSize[;CodeStart;CodeEnd][;CodeAddr]"

Examples:

1. "1", "1;0x0;0x0", "1;0x200000;0x350000"
2. "2", "2;0x0;0x0;0", "2;0x200000;0x350000;288"
3. "3;0x0;0x0;288", "3;0x200000;0x350000;288;0x404d50;0x425c88"
4. "4;0x0;0x0;288", "4;0x200000;0x350000;288;0x404d50;0x425c88;0x40f4e7"

You see, we can also do this in only two stages: stages 2 and 4. Size 0 means
that all sizes are recorded in stage 2. The ugtrain expands the first example
string to the second in stages 1 and 2. 0x0;0x0 in the heap filter means
unfiltered. The libmemdisc tells you about heap start and stack end. In stages
3 and 4 ugtrain finds out the code start and end for you by "objdump -p"-based
binary header extraction. Only the malloc size is important there.

Returns:

1. "m0x87acd0;s288", "f0x87acd0"
--> 'm' for malloc and 'f' for free, the address is the memory address of
the object, 's' is the size in bytes
2. "m0x87acd0;s288"
3. "m0x87acd0;s288;c0x40f4e7;c0x417801"
--> 'c' is the code address in the backtrace
4. "m0x87acd0;s288;c0x40f4e7;o0x28;c0x417801;o0x48"
--> 'o' is the reverse stack offset of the code address

The results are written with caching directly from /tmp/memhack_out into the
file /tmp/memhack_file. After ending the game ugtrain asks you for a memory
address from parallel static memory search. Enter it and ugtrain will search
for the matching malloc calls. It is very likely that interesting objects
are kept until game end. So they should be at the end of that list. But as in
stage 3 and 4 the "objdump -D"-based symbol lookup is quite slow, we reverse
that list and the interesting malloc is at the top. This way you can interrupt
the symbol lookup earlier.

Example stage 2:

$ ugtrain -D "2" examples/chromium-bsu64.conf
...
Memory address (e.g. 0xdeadbeef): 0x87ad8c
Searching reverse for 0x87ad8c in discovery output..
m0x87acd0;s288 contains 0x87ad8c, offs: 0xbc, heap offs: 0x2257f0
m0x87acd0;s344 contains 0x87ad8c, offs: 0xbc, heap offs: 0x2257f0
m0x87acd0;s344 contains 0x87ad8c, offs: 0xbc, heap offs: 0x2257f0
...

This shows us that the malloc size is 288 bytes and the offset in the object
is 0xbc (used the lives in the HeroAircraft object in Chromium B.S.U. 64-bit).
We also get to know the heap offset.

Example stage 4:

$ ugtrain -D "4;0x0;0x0;288" examples/chromium-bsu64.conf
...
Memory address (e.g. 0xdeadbeef): 0x8a605c
Searching reverse for 0x8a605c in discovery output..
m0x8a5fa0;s288 contains 0x8a605c, offs: 0xbc, heap offs: 0x250ac0
c0x40f4e7;o0x28 <_Znwm@plt>
c0x417801;o0x48
c0x404be6;o0x78
...

Only <*@plt> direct library calls are displayed and "_Znwm" on the first
position is exactly what we are looking for. It is a C++ internal function
which calls "malloc" internally. On 32-bit systems it is called "_Znwj".
We can see the reverse stack offset is 0x28. It would be lower if "malloc"
would have been called directly from the game binary (e.g. 0x8). We also
get to know the code jump back address 0x40f4e7.

That's it! We can write a basic config for the lives in chromium-bsu. We
start with a watcher in order to verify that our findings are correct.

chromium-bsu
dynmemstart HeroAircraft 288 0x40f4e7 0x28
Lives 0xbc i32 watch
dynmemend

$ ugtrain -P test.conf


=== Finding more Values in Dynamic Memory ===

In the game we can use the object dump now by pressing the '>' key. For our
example there should be the HeroAircraft object dumped as "0_000.dump". Before
the '_' there is the class index and after it the object index. Just compare
two dumps: when you are low on everything and when you are high on everything.
This way you can easily find other values like ammo and shields. A zero is also
with a float a zero in hex. The .dump files are binary files so either you use
a binary diff tool or you convert it into text first and use a text diff tool
like e.g. "meld". Conversion can be done as follows:

$ xxd 0_000.dump > 0_000.dump.txt

The tool "xxd" is part of the "vim" package.

If you've got a lot of objects and don't know exactly which ones are yours and
which ones are enemies, use the binary diff tool "ugsimfind". It compares upto
100 object files byte by byte and tells you for each byte its value as well as
how many and which files have the same value. This is very very useful if you
are searching the u8 player ID in Warzone 2100 Droids. Use it as follows:

$ ugsimfind 0_*.dump | less

fidx: 0x22
0x00 '.' : 7    0_000.dump, 0_001.dump, 0_042.dump, 0_043.dump, 0_044.dump,
0_045.dump, 0_046.dump,
0x07 '.' : 26   0_002.dump, 0_003.dump, 0_004.dump, 0_005.dump, 0_006.dump,
0_007.dump, 0_008.dump, ...,
0x06 '.' : 14   0_010.dump, 0_011.dump, 0_012.dump, 0_019.dump, 0_020.dump,
0_021.dump, 0_022.dump, ...,

The campaign starts with 7 own Droids and 40 enemies in Warzone 2100. From the
name string we know that these are exactly these 7. We have player ID 0 and the
AI has ID 6 and ID 7. So at offset 0x22 is our player ID.
