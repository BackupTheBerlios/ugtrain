### DESCRIPTION ###
###################
# ugtrain is an universal game trainer for the CLI. It doesn't search any
# values in memory to make it simple. This is the tool to be used after
# knowing the memory addresses and structures where the values should be
# freezed in memory. You can search the values e.g. with the GTK+ tool
# "gamecheater", the CLI tool "scanmem", the C# tool "Tursiops" or the
# Qt tool "QGSpider".
#
# Some of these can also freeze memory values. Where is the difference?
#
# Well, this tool is for the CLI, it will become multi-platform, and
# it will also support dynamic structures like vectors and lists.
# It already supports universal checks to prevent changing values
# e.g. while in the game main menu or making an opponent immortal by
# accident in a vector. With the config files you can also exchange
# your trainer config with others without recompilation.
#
# Why a CLI tool?
#
# CLI is important e.g. if you play full screen in WINE. Some people
# start another X session for the game but I don't like that. Moreover,
# you will be able to use this tool for trainer creation out of another
# tool (e.g. memory search tool) or you will be able to write your own
# GUI frontend for it. CLI tools can last tens of years while GUIs change
# more frequently.
#
# Please read TODO for further information.

### HOW TO BUILD AND USE ###
############################
# Make sure that the "autotools" package is installed on your system.

# Run the following command to generate the missing autotools files:
./autogen.sh

# Configure the build afterwards to generate the Makefiles:
./configure

# Build the ugtrain binary with:
make

# install ugtrain and libgcheater to /usr/local
sudo make install

# Use the compiled tool as follows:
ugtrain <config>

# This searches in the current working directory for the <config>.conf.
# Do e.g. the following:
cd examples
ugrain test

# This parses the test.conf from the examples, searches for the running
# instance of the game and starts freezing the configured values.
# In the examples the config syntax is described.
