#    by non-blocking getch and toggle the activation state at runtime. Multiple
#    keys for the same value and multiple values for the same key are possible.
#
#    The activation state can be directly set to active ('a') or deactivated
#    ('d') upon trainer start in the last colomn.
#
#    Check entry:
# check OffsInObj DataType <'l' or 'g'> CheckValue
#
#    Checks are applied to the previously defined value.
